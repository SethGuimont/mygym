My Gym Website:

This project is a theoretical site that I have created using the Elegance bootstrap with the
backend of it simply being express.js.  The goal of this project is to showcase my 
abilities for front end development and proficiency in engineering Selenium tests using
Java.

There will be another Java program that will test all basic functionality the site will have,
which will be filling out a new student form and confirming the request has been sent successfully.
